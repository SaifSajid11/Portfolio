- *Pollutant Averages*: Displays the average levels of NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5 for the selected city.
- *Geospatial Visualization*: An interactive map of India highlighting AQI levels in different regions using color-coded markers.
- *Top and Least Polluted Cities*: A ranking of cities with the highest and lowest AQI values, enabling quick comparisons.

### Technologies Used
- *Power BI*: For creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations.
- *Data Sources*: AQI data from reliable sources (e.g., government or environmental organizations).

### Key Insights
- Compare pollution levels across Indian cities and states.
- Track the improvement or degradation of air quality over time.
- Identify the most and least polluted regions in India.

This project is an excellent tool for researchers, policymakers, and environmental enthusiasts to understand and monitor air quality trends in India.
