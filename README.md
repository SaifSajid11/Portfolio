###SQL Music Store Data Project: Data Analysis and Insights 

This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL through a series of advanced queries aimed at extracting actionable insights from relational databases. Key highlights include:  

1. Database Exploration:* Retrieved and analyzed data from tables such as artist, employee, invoice, and customer to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset structure and relationships.  
2. Data Aggregation and Ranking:* Identified the senior-most employee, countries with the highest number of invoices, and cities with the highest invoice totals.  
3. Customer and Sales Insights:* Discovered the best customers based on spending patterns and identified the top-performing artist and rock music listeners.  
4. Performance Metrics:* Calculated and filtered tracks with durations exceeding the average length, ordering them by longest first.  
5. Advanced SQL Techniques:* Utilized joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to answer complex business questions, such as total spending on artists by customers.  

This project showcases my ability to write optimized SQL queries for data analysis, reporting, and deriving meaningful business insights. 
It emphasizes my skills in statistical analysis, data visualization preparation, and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.

###Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard for India

This project is an interactive dashboard that visualizes the Air Quality Index (AQI) data for various cities across India. It provides insights into pollution levels and key pollutants such as NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5. The dashboard is built to allow users to select a city and view detailed air quality trends and comparisons.

## Features
- *City-Level Analysis*: Select any city to view its specific air quality details.
- *AQI Trend Overview*: A line chart displaying the AQI trend over the years (2015-2020) for the selected city.
- *Pollutant Averages*: Displays the average levels of NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5 for the selected city.
- *Geospatial Visualization*: An interactive map of India highlighting AQI levels in different regions using color-coded markers.
- *Top and Least Polluted Cities*: A ranking of cities with the highest and lowest AQI values, enabling quick comparisons.

## Technologies Used
- *Power BI*: For creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations.
- *Data Sources*: AQI data from reliable sources (e.g., government or environmental organizations).

## Key Insights
- Compare pollution levels across Indian cities and states.
- Track the improvement or degradation of air quality over time.
- Identify the most and least polluted regions in India.

This project is an excellent tool for researchers, policymakers, and environmental enthusiasts to understand and monitor air quality trends in India.
